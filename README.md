# Deepfake Generation and Detection

ðŸŽ­ *An AI-powered project for generating and detecting deepfake media using GANs and CNNs.*

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project addresses the growing challenges posed by deepfakes through two main components:

1. **Deepfake Generation**  
   - Utilizes a custom GAN-based architecture to generate synthetic human faces.
   - Implements face-swapping techniques to create deepfake videos.

2. **Deepfake Detection**  
   - Employs a CNN-based classifier (ResNet18) to detect real vs fake media.
   - Trained on publicly available Real/Fake datasets for high accuracy.

The aim is to demonstrate both the creation and detection of deepfakes for **research and educational purposes only**.
